    <p class="me-text">I started working with computer based technologies when I developed an interest in audio technology at school. Since then I have gained a degree in Music Production and have been employed in various capacities within music, theatre and education. My experience of combining technical and creative skills within collaborative environments led me to pursue new challenges in web development. I saw an opportunity to be part of an expanding community and to learn and be challenged while doing work that I love. Beyond my web development work I continue to write and perform music, tinker with my bike, drink inordinate amounts of Ethiopian filter coffee and peruse record shops.</p>

  <h4>General Assembly - Web Design Immersive Course </h4></br>
  <i>Aug 2016- Oct 2016</i>
  <p class="me-text">
    I undertook this course in order to start a career as a web developer. WDI is a full-time twelve week program designed to teach students proficiency in current industry technologies and the ability to work effectively through the process of planning and implementing projects both individually and collaboratively. Throughout WDI the importance of test driven development, agile methodology and effective in-depth planning processes was made clear and each day would begin with a class stand up.
    During the course we were required to complete four major projects, details of which I have included under the <a class="page-link" href="/projects/">projects</a> tab.
