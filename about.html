<div class="about-1">
  <div class="me"></div>


    <p>I started working with computer based technologies when I developed an interest in audio production at school. Since then I have gained a degree in Music Production and have been employed in various capacities within music, theatre and education. My experience of combining technical and creative skills within collaborative environments lead me to pursue new challenges in web development. I saw an opportunity to be part of an expanding community and to learn and be challenged while doing work that I love. Beyond my web development work I continue to write and perform music, tinker with my bike, drink inordinate amounts of Ethiopian filter coffee and peruse record shops for interesting vinyl.</p>
